\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Project overview}
E commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used \\ business
paradigm.More and more business houses are implementing web sites
providing functionality for performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is becoming common place.In our website an admin can sell electornic accessories like mobile,watch,laptop etc.

\subsection{Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{Background of the Project Effort}
The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where electronic accessories   can be bought from the comfort of home through the internet. However, for implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online shopping for Electronic accessories.
\subsubsection{ Goals of the Project}
An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time,the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually , the customer will be asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as bKash, or Cash on delivery. An e-mail notification is sent to the customer as soon as the order is placed.
\subsection{The Scope of Work}
With the developing utilization of media machines like a Smartphone, workstation, PC with web access, the skyline of e-commerce business improvement is extending day-by-day. Due to the accessibility of contraptions and simple web access has lead individuals to web-based shopping.

 \section{System Analysis}
 Feasibility Study:A feasibility study examines the practicability of an idea, a project or even a new business.The objective of feasibility study is to place an accentuation on latent issues that could befall if the project is sought after and decide whether, after every substantial factor are taken into account, the project should be pursued or not. It enables organizations to determine all of the obligatory details to make a business prosperous. A feasibility study distinguishes strategic issues, and almost all business-related issues, alongside providing answers to lighten them. The operational (will it work?), economical (cost and benefits) and technical (can it be built?) aspects are part of the study.
 
    • Operational Feasibility
    • Technical Feasibility
    • Economic Feasibility
    • Schedule Feasibility

 

\subsection{Operational Feasibility}
The  Operational  feasibility  evaluation  concentrates   on  how  much  the  proposed
advancement project fits  in with the current institute condition and targets concerning
improvement plan, ease the learning process and keep the students up to date.To guarantee achievement, desired operational results must be conveyed during design and development. These incorporate such outline subordinate parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others.
Here in our Department Collaboration system since the student ,teachers also admins are enough educated so we think it possible to incorporate the outlines of the operational parameters.

\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
Technical feasibility is a procedure of determining if the organization has the innovation
assets to create or buy, introduce, and operate the system. Does the organization have the
mechanical assets to embrace the venture?
It is highly feasible for this organization to continue this system.Technical requirements are easy to fulfil.All are available at the hand. We also suggest contacting a hosting company to take necessary steps to host this system.

\subsection{Economic Feasibility}

System development and yearly working expenses are the two essential segments used to decide the cost gauges for a proposed information system.Since this system is developed for our course so there no

expense for development.The Yearly working expenses are the hosting charge ,maintenance and other charges.According to the cost scenario the system is feasible.

\subsection{Schedule Feasibility}
As indicated by Shelly Cashman (2010), schedule feasibility can be characterized as, the way toward deciding if a venture can be executed inside a given time allotment in connection to the organizational due dates and constraints. Fundamentally, it is the way toward dissecting the time period  as to when the  venture  might  be  finished. This  possibility  covers  how  the assignments should be partitioned and the measure of time therefore utilized for the  effective culmination of the venture.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
A UML use case diagram is the primary form of system/software requirements for a new software program underdeveloped. Use cases specify the expected behavior (what), and not the exact method of making it happen (how).A key concept of use case modeling is that it helps us design a system from the end user's perspective. It is an effective technique for communicating system behavior in the user's terms by specifying all externally visible system behavior.

\section{Conclusion}
After careful observation, it has come to my conclusion that e-commerce has undeniably become an important part of our society. The world wide web is and will have a large part in our daily lives. It is therefore critical that small businesses have their own to keep in competition with the larger websites. Since web developers have lowered down the prices for their services, it has become more affordable for small businesses to use the world wide web to sell their products. Although there are negative aspects of e-commerce, small businesses have tried to accommodate to the needs of the consumers. For example, one of the negative aspects of e-commerce is that consumers lack the advice and guidance of sellers, to accommodate that, they have customer service through the phone of online to answer any questions. It is also important to note that e-commerce does not benefit all small companies equally. How much revenue a business gets from e-commerce depends on what kind of service it gives. For example, most people would like to try on clothes before they buy them, so it probably would not benefit a small business that sells clothes as much as a small business that sells home supplies or specialty books. Nevertheless, e-commerce does benefit any business even in small ways. This is why it is crucial to understand how e-commerce affects small businesses because it is becoming such a huge part of how society functions that it effects the economy greatly and whatever happens to the economy affects us. This is why is it important to understand this subject because in the long run, it will affect all of us.
